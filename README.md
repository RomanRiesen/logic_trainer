# logic-trainer

Horrendous and inefficient and the parser is not even really working. Should not be used or looked at.

# TODO:
## Top Priority:
1 inverse functions
2 Read formula
3 apply to non-top level symbol

## UI:
- Don't forget to sanitize input...
- Different show instance for web, being able to choose symbol set
- Show logic formula, then show simplification with step by step solution, of course.
- Let convolute entered formula

## Far off:
- Proover?
- Letting user choose what function to apply (really clashes with the application to non-root elements in the gui)
